    <p>Tel Aviv is Israel's cultural and commercial capital. Named “The Mediterranean Capital of Cool” by the New York Times, Tel Aviv is a city with a savvy attitude and cultural astuteness. “The city which never sleeps” is a center for nightlife, cuisine, culture, and liberalism. <br><br>On a personal note, I spent this past summer (June - August) living and working in Tel Aviv. Below, you'll find some of my favorite restaurants, beach spots, and more.</p>

        <h2>The Food</h2> 
        Tel Aviv is known internationally for the rich cuisine and wide variety of restaurants. I was shocked to see the thriving hamburger culture - the city is lined with high-end gourmet hamburger stores that are some of the best burgers I've had in my life. There's also plenty of small falafel and shawarma shops, upscale sushi restaurants, and more creative options.

            <h3>Shuk HaCarmel - Carmel Market</h3> 
            <img src = "https://aisrael.org/_uploads/extraimg/carmel-market-tel-aviv.jpg" meta = "image of a Carmel Market, open air" width = "320" height = "212.5"></img>
            <p>Shuk HaCarmel translates to Carmel Market - this open air grocery market is a fantastic place to grab something to eat, pick up some groceries for the house, or just to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere. It's loaded with tourists, travelers, and locals trying to get some cheap fruits and vegetables. Between the legendary fish sandwich and falafels in pita, you can't go wrong going to the Shuk for lunch.</p>

            <h3>GDB - George's Dry Aged Burger</h3> 
            <img src = "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JM_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/469954" meta = "image of a cheeseburger at George's Dry Aged Burger" width = "320" height = "214"></img>
            <p>Trust me when I tell you that this is the best burger money can buy in Tel Aviv and in my humble opinion, this is the best burger in the world. I've never enjoyed something so much between the arugula, garlic mayo, and even the jalapenos do a lot to add to the bite. The dry aged meat is phenomenal quality and makes it stand out among the many other burger shops in Tel Aviv.</p>

        <h2>Points of Interest</h2>
        From spending time at the beach to walking around Rothschild, there are so many different landmarks and buzzing areas to check out in the city. Nightlife in Tel Aviv is also super popular since about 1/4 of the city's population is in their 20s. 
        <div class = "Beach" id = "beach"> 
            <h3>Jerusalem Beach</h3> 
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Jerusalem_Beach_-_Tel_Aviv_%285101642680%29.jpg" meta = "image of a Jerusalem Beach shoreline" width = "384" height = "256"></img>
            <p>Located just a street or two off the Shuk, Jerusalem Beach is lined with luxury hotels and stores. It tends to be one of the quieter beaches along Tel Aviv's shoreline, especially during the weekdays. Lifeguards staff the beach during regular business hours and tasty treats such as Aroma and great falafel are just across the street.</p>

        <div class = "Rothschild" id = "rothschild">
            <h3>Rothschild Boulevard</h3>

            <p>Rothschild Boulevard is home to Meta, Google and many other high profile companies. The famous pedestrian walkway stays in the shade all day long thanks to the beautiful trees up and down the street. Rothschild also has a wide array of bars, nightclubs, and restaurants including Drama Bar, Jimmy Who, and more.</p>
