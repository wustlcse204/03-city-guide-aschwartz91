# Assignment 03: City Guide

For this assignment, you will be creating a simple website to act as a guide to your favorite city. Your website should highlight 4-5 of your favorite places in your favorite city. These can include restaurants, parks, museums, activities, or other features you enjoy about the city.

Your content should be well organized and include many of the HTML elements we have learned so far, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and semantic text.
